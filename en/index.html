            <p>During this internship, the company asked me to design a <strong>recruitment website</strong>. I started by creating <strong>wireframes</strong> and <strong>mockups</strong> in <strong>Figma</strong> to prepare the structure of the website. Then, I <strong>developed</strong> it using HTML, PHP, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring it was responsive to all screen sizes. I also implemented an application form allowing the company to receive candidates for multiple positions. Finally, I ensured the website was properly tested on different browsers and platforms. Additionally, I worked on some extra projects related to the website, such as graphic and promotional design.</p>
            <p>I really enjoyed this internship because it allowed me to use and develop my <strong>skills</strong> in <strong>various fields</strong>: UX and UI, obviously, but also graphic design, 3D infographics, and coding. I also significantly improved my programming skills by developing the website.</p>

            <a href="" target="_blank" class="link">View the mockup on Figma</a>
            <p>For my final Bachelor cycle project, I chose to work on French <strong>university restaurants</strong> and imagine ways to improve their <strong>user experience</strong>. After dining in these restaurants several times, I noticed that <strong>long waiting times</strong> could prevent some students from enjoying these meals, and there was significant <strong>food waste</strong>.</p>
            <p>I thought of ways to address these issues through a <strong>mobile app</strong> and some adjustments in the restaurants. The app I envisioned allows students to get real-time information about their favorite university restaurants, such as <strong>menus</strong> and <strong>food quantities</strong>, as well as the <strong>estimated waiting time</strong> at the entrance, without having to go there and waste valuable minutes of their short lunch break. It also offers a <strong>click and collect</strong> feature in certain types of restaurants, and community members can suggest dishes they’d like to see in their favorite establishments. All these features aim to <strong>make meals easier</strong> for students without them having to rush during their short breaks, giving them a bit of control over the menus.</p>
            <p>This project was purely focused on <strong>user experience and interface design</strong>. I started by conducting extensive research in various fields and learned a lot about university restaurants. I also <strong>discussed with the team</strong> of a university restaurant to understand how they operated and which of my ideas were most feasible. Then, I imagined the app's features, organized them into menus and pages, and finally created the project’s identity and visuals.</p>

            <p class="caption">Iterative Project (school project) · November 2022 to February 2023 · 4 months · 4 people</p>
            <p>We worked with Nantes Métropole on this project. The city hall asked us to review the <strong>city’s app</strong> and come up with <strong>new ways to interact and navigate</strong> within it. We used the <strong>Scrum</strong> method, which involves precisely organizing the tasks each team member needs to accomplish and completing them in a short period called a “sprint” before presenting the results to the partners and incorporating their feedback to continue.</p>
            <p>We created <strong>interactive prototypes</strong> with <strong>Figma</strong> to showcase the app's envisioned features, and we used <strong>Notion</strong> to assign tasks and <strong>plan</strong> everything.</p>
            <p>Scrum is a way to quickly <strong>conceive and implement new ideas</strong> for a service. We documented our design concepts for the app and decided which ones were the best to <strong>prioritize</strong> tasks and <strong>prototype</strong> these concepts in several hours of work.</p>
            <p>This project allowed me to explore <strong>new methods</strong> of organization and ideation, as well as to work within a <strong>larger team</strong> in collaboration with a company. The managers of Nantes Métropole in My Pocket were <strong>interested</strong> in our proposals for this app designed to improve and facilitate the lives of Nantes residents, and they always provided feedback to improve our ideas.</p>

            <h3>Concept Store Design Project</h3>
            <p class="caption">Short project (school project) · March 2022 · 4 weeks · 2 people</p>
            <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/fScQpJJanfPsv1Zy2GPo0R/PopBusters-%3A-UI-kit-et-maquettes?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=33-1532&starting-point-node-id=33%3A1532&t=AORgiSvgFSSacQJK-1" target="_blank" class="link">View the prototype on Figma</a>
            <p>For this project, we had to design a <strong>concept store</strong> and its website in pairs. Since we both love <strong>cinema</strong>, we decided to create a concept store linked to this art form. We then had to choose the brand’s <strong>visual identity</strong>: its logo, colors, and typography. Our inspiration came from <strong>cinema-related elements</strong> such as popcorn, films, and the red color associated with theater seats. Finally, we created the <strong>wireframes</strong> and <strong>prototype</strong> of the website.</p>
            <p>The result is a <strong>virtual concept store</strong> for blockbuster fans, where they can rent original and iconic pieces from cult films. The logo was created using <strong>Illustrator</strong>, the 3D images were made with <strong>Blender</strong>, and the prototypes were designed in <strong>Figma</strong>.</p>
            <p>During this project, I was able to express my <strong>creativity</strong> and explore themes I enjoy, while also working with 3D software. From modeling and texture creation to animation, I significantly improved my <strong>3D skills</strong> through Popbusters. I also extensively used Figma’s prototyping features to design <strong>user-friendly animations</strong>.</p>

            <p class="caption">After Effects (school project) · April 2022 · 4 weeks · Solo project</p>
            <p>I later had the opportunity to create a 30-second <strong>motion design</strong> video showcasing this fictional brand and all its visuals, working again with <strong>Blender</strong> and <strong>After Effects</strong>. Since I enjoy creating visual elements, animating, and editing videos, this introductory After Effects course allowed me to use some of the assets I had already created and further <strong>expand</strong> the Popbusters universe.</p>

            <p>A year later, I had to create a video combining real footage and special effects in three days. With my group, we decided to build upon Popbusters and made a short fictional advertisement using <strong>video compositing</strong> and 3D animated elements. This allowed me to enhance my video skills and handle the <strong>sound design</strong>, from effects to music, for this short spot, as I’m very interested in sound engineering and music creation.</p>

            <h3>Esprits Émotifs</h3>
            <p class="caption">Creative Coding Workshop (school project) · January 2022 · 4 days · 3 people</p>
            <p>In groups of three, we had to create a generative and interactive installation using <strong>Processing</strong>, a programming language. We explored <strong>interactive solutions</strong> and imagined a <strong>poetic universe</strong>. Our code-generated graphics were projected onto a wall, and a webcam recognized masks made for the installation. Users could pick up a mask from a table and show it to the camera. A unique graphic and musical universe was triggered depending on the mask, with each universe representing a different emotion.</p>
            <p>This playful project involved UX, graphic design, machine learning, and programming. It was very <strong>educational</strong>. I also had the opportunity to compose the installation’s <strong>music</strong>, making this intense week of work even more enjoyable.</p>

            <p class="caption">Arcade & Craft & Alternative Controller Workshop (school project) · January 2023 · 4 days · 5 people</p>
            <p>In the arcade workshop, we had to create an <strong>interactive game without a screen</strong> in groups of five. We were tasked with using an unconventional controller, <strong>Arduino devices</strong>, and building the game using available materials (wood, cardboard, etc.). We designed a game where players feed a marmot by grabbing fake food at the start of the path with a hand-shaped spatula and guiding it to the end as quickly as possible, avoiding obstacles and preventing the food from falling. We used light sensors, servo motors, and lots of wiring and code to build the entire game. It’s <strong>fun</strong> to play and fosters competition between players, encouraging them to beat the high score, reminiscent of old arcade games.</p>
            <p>This workshop was an opportunity to work as a team, brainstorm creative ideas for the game’s design, and improve my <strong>programming skills</strong>.</p>

            <h3>Tako</h3>
            <p class="caption">Network Workshop (school project) · May 2023 · 4 days · 6 people</p>
            <p>The Network workshop involved creating a <strong>massively multiplayer game</strong> in four days, in groups of six. The game was to run on a main screen visible to all players, with their smartphones acting as individual controllers. We designed a game where two teams compete in a tug-of-war contest. Players scan a QR code on the main screen to join a team, turning their phone into a controller to pull the rope with their team and recruit more players to tilt the balance in their favor.</p>
            <p>During this project, I enjoyed programming the node server and the web page players could access, while learning new terminal commands and deepening my back-end programming knowledge. I also used my sound design skills to create a musical atmosphere and sound effects for the game.</p>
